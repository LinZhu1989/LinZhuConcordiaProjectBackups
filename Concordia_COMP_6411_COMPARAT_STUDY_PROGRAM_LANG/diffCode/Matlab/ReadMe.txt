Language Description 

MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a numerical computing environment and fourth-generation programming language. Developed by MathWorks, 
MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces,
and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, Java, and Fortran.

As the name suggests, Matlab is especially designed for matrix computations: solving systems of linear equations, computing 
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, factoring matrices, and so forth. In addition, it has a variety of graphical capabilities, and 
can be extended through programs written in its own programming language. Many such programs come with the system; a number 
of these extend Matlab's capabilities to nonlinear problems, such as the solution of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations.
Matlab is designed to solve problems numerically, that is, in finite-precision arithmetic. Therefore it produces approximate rather than exact solutions, and should not be confused with a symbolic computation system (SCS) such as Mathematica or Maple. It should be understood that this does not make Matlab better or worse than an SCS; it is a tool designed for different tasks and is therefore not directly comparable.

############################ How to use it ##############################
#########################################################################

1, Run the Matlab.exe
2, Find the location of the folder which contains all the code files
3, Ways of Use
	
	1)	Type in 
			calculateLengthWithInput()
		then you are asked for typing in the value of R and accurarcy 
		Finally, you can have the results.

	2)	Type in 
			graphLengthWithR( a , lr , rr)
		
		a is the value of accurarcy you want to use;
		lr is the value of the lower boundary of the R;
		rr is the value of the upprr boundary of the R;
		the range of lr to rr is the one you want to show in teh graph
		Type in your accurarcy and your range of R, you can have the graphs which clearly shows all the information included.
